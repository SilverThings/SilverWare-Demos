# SilverWare Examples

In this repository you can find all demonstartions and quickstart examples for SilverWare.
It is divided into two categories:

1. Demos - these are complex examples usually presented at conferences and other events.
2. Quickstarts - simple examples, each of the typically showing a single feature, can be used as basic building blocks and code templates.

## Demos

* __openalt-2015__ Example showed at OpenAlt 2015 in Brno. 
  Consists of three services - a temperature sensor register, a value filter that removes duplicates, and an InfluxDB writer. All are CDI microservices.

## Quickstarts

* __camel-helloworld__ Simple Camel microservice - a route from timer to log and stream using route specified in a _Java class_.
* __camel-helloworld-xml__ Simple Camel microservice - a route from timer to log and stream using route specified in an XML file.
* __cdi-helloworld__ Integration of Camel and CDI microservices - a Camel route defined in a Java class sends messages to a CDI microservice.
